# Shelf Life

A simple app to help you search for books as well as add books you have read, want to read, and are currently reading.

## Getting Started

yarn install
react-native run-ios

you must also navigate to /server and 'yarn start' there

Please note: when you are at your bookshelf page and would like to move a book to a new shelf, long press on that book and the drawer menu will pop up.

### Prerequisites

hopefully yarn takes care of all these packages
